- A public member function  change_current_mesh() was added to reduce code duplication.
- Vertexes can be incremented into infinity. Not sure if it should be restricted since there
  is no information about it in the lab description.
- Insert and Delete instead of '+' and '-' due to the lack of a numpad :)
- If a ogrehead is removed and the currently selected ogrehead mesh is the removed one 
  the selected ogrehead will move to the last ogrehead
